  ## Description
  This is my portfolio/personal website. Made with React, showcases what I can do inside of what I can do. Has a form to sign up for email updates through MailChimp, and has a contact form which actually works like a real contact form. File structure isn't great and the navbar doesn't act correctly on mobile but I'll keep working on it.
